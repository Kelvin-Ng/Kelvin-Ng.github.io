title: My Role in the Lab

As an undergraduate student, my role in the lab is tricky. It becomes more tricky after the sad story.

Ideally, after finishing my own wave of deadlines, I could resume my work on the project and have discussions with the teammates. However, I am totally isolated and this is frustrating. I have no chance to contribute or learn.

I understand that I do not deserve getting anything. No one is responsible for helping or teaching me. I did not make enough contributions in the project, and I am not even officially affiliated with the lab. However, it is frustrating to see others getting help from a talented guy and learn quickly, while I need to work and learn alone with low efficiency, trying hard to chase behind them.

I am selfish. I pretended that the sad story did not occur. I tried to join their discussions. I tried my best to know what they were taught and tried to learn that on my own. Sometimes I cryptically asked my closest friend in the lab to share what she got from the talented guy and learnt on my own. This was morally bad because I got something not belongs to me in a tricky way, but since I think it does not hurt others anyway, I will continue doing that.

I would not say that I have no choice or I am forced to do so. I am not forced. I can always choose not to care what they have got and learn on my own slowly. But I am selfish. I want to get what others get.

Forgive me for being a bad person.
