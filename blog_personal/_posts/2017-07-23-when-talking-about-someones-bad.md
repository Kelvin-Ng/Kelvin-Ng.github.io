title: When Talking about someone's Bad...

I am...

1. Very happy when someone directly tells me *what* I do not do well with reasons
2. Happy when someone directly tells me *what* I do not do well without reasons
3. Indifferent when someone directly tells me *that* I do not do well (this is always without reasons)
4. Indifferent when someone tells another one behind me about some facts on me that he deems not good, but he does not add any personal opinion
5. A bit angry when someone tells another one behind me about *what* I do not do well with reasons
6. Angry when someone tells another one behind me about *what* I do not do well without reasons
7. Very angry when someone tells another one behind me *that* I do not do well (this is always without reasons)

Sometimes I do 5 on others. That's no good. I am not aware of that I did 6 and 7 on others before. Hope that I didn't.

Someone did 4 and 5 on me. I am OK.

I know that someone did 7 on someone. Not sure if I should tell the second someone or not. Maybe telling the second someone means that I do 5 on the first someone. Also, it could hurt the second someone without any constructive consequence. But, isn't knowing that the rights of the second someone? Sigh...
