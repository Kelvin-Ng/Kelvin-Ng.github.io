Principles can be maintained only when you have power.

You start to gain power once you realize it.

You hope that, one day, you have enough power to maintain your principles.

Power is infinite. Humans are greedy.

Getting more power, you want more. You're never satisfied.

You said you'll maintain your principle once you gain more power.

But you never do.

<br> <br>

Gaining of power is gradual.

Maintaining different principles in different situations requires different level of power.

Every day you gain more, but you never get all.

Check what you get every day.

Use the power you get to maintain what you can.

Never forget your principle.

勿忘初心。
