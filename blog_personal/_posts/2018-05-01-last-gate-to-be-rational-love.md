title: Last Step to be Rational - Love

I think I am now very rational to almost everything. I can see almost all the difficulties calmly, analyse and solve them in a rational manner. If I deem some difficulties unsolvable after thorough analysis, I can let it go without any bad emotion.

Except when it is related to the one I love.

How come I am hurt by her so many times but I still love her? Every time I tell myself to forget her, I failed after an hour.

How come I could be hurt by her? Shouldn't I keep calm in any situation?

I always believed that love can be rational. I love someone if and only if she is good in all aspects that I care. The criteria are subjective, but they can be followed rationally, as many philosophers do. But how come when I find that she is not good in some aspects that I care, I still love her? There is no point to love a person who makes me suffer more than feel happy...
