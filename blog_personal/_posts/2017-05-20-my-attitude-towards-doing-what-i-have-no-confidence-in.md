title: My Attitude towards Doing what I have no Confidence in

Yesterday I participated in the CSE programming contest. It is an ACM ICPC-like contest, and I have no confidence in such kind of contests.

Problems are difficult to solve, as expected. I solved 2 problems out of 7, and ranked 10th. After learning the solutions, I found that most of the unsolved problems were really beyond my ability and it was not surprising that I failed to solve, except one of them.

This problem is not difficult. In fact I was about to get the solution. In some sense I did get the solution. However, I did not continue to follow this line of thought. I felt that it was too troublesome. I suddenly wanted to give up without any reason. So, I did not work out the solution.

This is a serious attitude problem and reminds me of many similar scenarios happened before. I easily give up a task that is beyond my expected ability. I am sure that I could solve this problem if it appeared in a course exam, because I am confident that I can solve all problems in an undergraduate course and so I will try my best to solve it. Similarly, I failed to solve a problem appearing in an algorithm design context because I was not confident in solving algorithm problems, but I solved the same problem when it appeared in a system design context, because I was confident in my ability in system design.

I should not stay in the comfort zone. I should always try my very best to solve any problem, no matter it is what I am confident in or not.

I have to learn from this lesson.
