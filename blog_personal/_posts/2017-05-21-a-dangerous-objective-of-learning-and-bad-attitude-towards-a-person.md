title: A Dangerous Objective of Learning and Bad Attitude towards a Person
---

Today I have tried very hard to learn every important aspects about asynchronous programming, fibre, coroutine and Boost ASIO. This is because of two reasons:

1. This is interesting, useful and related to my field of interest. I think it is good to learn that.
2. I want to show to the project leader that not involving me is a flaw.

The first reason is not problemetic. I thought that it was the only reason until doing self reflection. The second reason is dangerous. It implies that:

1. My objective of learning is not pure.
2. I have bad attitude towards the project leader. It is his rights to choose involving me or not. It seems that in my unconscious mind, I do not agree with that. I feel angry with him by not involving me. This is not a good attitude. I have the responsibility to grasp opportunities. He has no responsibility for giving me opportunities.

It shows that I am a bad guy deep in my mind.
