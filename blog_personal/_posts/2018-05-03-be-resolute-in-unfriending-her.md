Why can't I be more resolute in unfriending her? She hurts me again and again after promising again and again. She never really changes! And now she promises, again, that she will change. Predicting from the history, this is clearly impossible. Why do I still trust her???

She thinks talking to me for that despite being busy is being 'considerate' to me. This makes me even more angry! Do you know how unhappy I have been by your irrespectful behaviours? Do you know how long I have been enduring that just because I know that you are very busy? How considerate I am! Do you know enduring that greatly reduce my working efficiency?

There is always a limitation for endurance. You challenged my limit again and again. I just couldn't endure it anymore! Being busy is not a reason for being irrespectful!

Aren't my requirements minimal? You want to say 'o' as an ACK? It looks more like making fun at me when I am serious! How come you can continue to hurt me even when I am complaining that you hurt me? How ignorant are you? Why do I need to 'teach' you how to meet this minimal requirement which should apply for any human being? I have never met any person who touch that line even once. You are the first and the only one, and touch that line many times!

And, why do I still keep your contacts after you made a promise that will never come true? How stupid am I?
