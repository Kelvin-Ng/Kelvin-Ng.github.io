title: The Importance of Effective Communication and Ways to Achieve
---

I did not do communication well. It discomforted others and created serious misunderstanding. I did feel that there was some discomfort but I did not know the reasons or how to solve, so I used the wrong way to 'solve' and create other discomfort and misunderstanding. A big thank to a friend of mine who explicitly told me the problem so that I could improve.

1. Say everything clearly. Something is trivial to a person but not another. Don't make implicit assumptions.
2. When delivering facts, don't make subjective judgements like, 'this is easy / difficult', 'it only wastes your time', etc. We do not have the rights to judge something for others. This is OK when discussing personal opinions, but do make justification, see point 1.
3. When others are learning, deliver facts in a guiding and constructive manner. Don't directly give out the answer as this is not constructive. Even if I think that the answer is trivial or it does not worth spending time finding the solution, see point 2. In some situations that the problem is really too meaningless to spend time on in my opinion, say that out with justification, disucss with them and ask them to make the decision on getting the solution directly or not. I don't have the rights to make decisions for others.
4. Give opinions on something not of my own business in a constructive and non-interrupting manner. When they are busy in solving other more important issues, give opinions on the less important issues later. When giving opinions, deliver clearly with justification and be sure to allow enough room for discussions.
5. Give opinions after knowing the context clearly and thorough thinking. Otherwise, the discussion is not constructive.
6. TODO: There is still a problem that I do not know how to solve.

I should make these points deep into my mind and practise them. This is of vital importance on effective communication and building up a positive personality.
