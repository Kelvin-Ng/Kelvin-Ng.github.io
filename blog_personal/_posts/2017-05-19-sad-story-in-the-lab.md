What happens in the lab these days is a black humour. A vicious circle is created and it is really difficult to break.

To make the long story short: When I was busy, I was expected to finish a lot of tasks. When I was free, I had no chance to finish any task.

I joined a project in the lab when I was free. I took and finished some tasks of the project. After that, I became busy in other more important stuff (to me) and did not take any new task. Although I worked day and night, I made no new contributions to the project. So, the project leader got angry. Since the deadline of the paper is in between my wave of other more important deadlines (to me), I made no new contributions until the paper's deadline.

I admit that I did not make enough contributions to the project, but I had my difficuties. Most of the people in the lab are working full-time for doing research, while I am an undergraduate student taking 7 courses, trying my best to squeeze some time for doing research. No wonder those working full-time can make a lot of contributions, even without much efforts. I had to finish the workload of two people, and probably more, to make the same amount of contributions.

I believe that my workload was at least comparable with many of others in the lab. I needed to finish four papers and one final exam within a week. *Four* papers, although obviously the requirements of these papers are much lower than that of the paper being submitted to the conference. Why did I need to finish them within a week? Couldn't I start working earlier? The answer is that, another two papers and two presentations were to be finished within the week before. The heavy workload can be traced back until when I was free and was working hard in the project. I admit that I did not make enough contributions, but I think it is unfair to deem me being not hardworking or make any negative judgement on my personality because of that.

I agree that I did not communicate well. I kept telling the project leader that I was busy in a casual manner. I should have made this statement serious so that he would not have unrealistic expectations on me. Also, I failed to estimate my workload. I kept saying that I would resume my work after my current wave of deadlines, but the next wave of deadlines came just after it, so I could not resume my work. However, I think it was impossible for me to predict, as my workload in this semester is much heavier than that of previous semesters. The heavy workload was totally out of my expectation and control. But anyhow, I will try to improve my communication skills and ability to estimate my workload so that others could make realistic expectations on me.

After the deadline, most of the people in the lab were very happy. Some of them went to travel, while others came back late and left early. Only few of us (including me) were still working day and night. They did not see that, as they were enjoying their holiday.

They resumed their work after their fruitful holidays. At that time I was also free as I have just finished most of my deadlines. The project leader proposed a continuation of the project, but I am not involved anymore. So, I have no chance to make any contributions to the project as an offset of my previous lack of contributions. I am forever the one who make not enough contributions. OK, no one has the responsibility to give me opportunities, but what can I do to show my value when I am always isolated from work and discussions?

At last, a sincere thank to one of my best friends who understood me and constantly supported me. It was really a hard time and I think I could not surrive without her.
