title: Reflection on My Philosophical Thought
---

I always claim that I am a Stoic, or a person who is working hard towards being a Stoic, although I always doubt a basic assumption of Stoicism. I thought that this assumption is not important, but after facing a lot of difficulties, I find that it is indeed important.

Stoicism assumes that:
1. The Universe is so complicated that human beings cannot handle most of the things. The God (not the same thing as in Christianity although they share the same name) controls everything (Fatalism).
2. The God has a plan on the Universe to make the Universe, as a whole, *the best possible*. It controls everything for achieving that.

These imply that:
1. Human beings should only care about what we can totally control. For the things that we can only partially control, care only the part that we can totally control.
2. We should believe that what is going on can benefit the most to the whole Universe. So, we should not feel unhappy when we fail to achieve our own goal (This is related to utilitarianism). We should always try to agree with the God. Our *virtue* is following the God's plan. Be indifferent to things not related to our virtue.
3. When we do not know what to do, try to follow the Nature. Animals / plants are directly controlled by the God and so we can *guess* the God's plan from their behaviours. However, if we fail to follow the Nature, we should not feel unhappy because this is still the God's plan (It only means that we wrongly guessed the God's plan).

(The terminology 'Nature' used here is the one used in normal conversion but not the one used in the Stoicism context.)

The second assumption does not look trivial to me. How could one show that the Universe is developing towards the best possible? By observing the beautiful sky? It only means that the sky is beautiful, not even necessarily of the highest beauty possible. If we assume that this assumption is true anyway, there is still another problem. Although following the God's plan can bring maximum benefit to the whole Universe, it does not bring maximum benefit to me. How could one *naturally* feel happy when something bad happens on him and only benefit others? I thought that this is not an important issue, though, because anyway I could not do anything more, because of the first assumption. Even if following the God's plan does not bring maximum benefit to *me*, my best choice is to follow the God's plan because I could not control most of the things.

I thought that this is OK, because anyway I am doing the best I can do, but recently I notice that this is not enough. I agree that this kind of thought helps me relief from some negative emotions, because it reliefs me from thinking about something useless. However, natually, I would still feel unhappy when something bad happens and I cannot control. Without the second assumption, or without agreeing with utilitarianism, this problem seems to be unsolvable within Stoicism.
