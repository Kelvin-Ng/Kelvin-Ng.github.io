Teaching is difficult. You need to:

1. Know his / her background. If his / her background cannot be accurately judged, don't think that always underestimating works. Sometimes you will run into troubles by that.
2. Guess what he / she does not understand / agree. Sometimes people just say that they do not understand / agree on something without explaining or giving reasons. This is not surprising because if he / she can clearly explain what he / she doesn't understand, he / she may be very close to the answer of what he / she is asking.
3. Convince that what I am talking about is related to his / her question by frequently connecting what I am talking directly to the question. It means that you sometimes need to jump steps, temporarily faking the audience because without the huge amount of intermeidate steps which looks unrelated, no correct logic relation can be formed.

The first two points are more like 'hard' skills. Although 'teaching' itself is a soft skill, the first two steps are 'harder' than the third. The third one requires the teacher to have a high mental ability to tolerate temporarily faking others (for doing something good, though), which I don't have. However, it seems to be really important for being a good teacher. Maybe I should practise it.
