Philosophy is a big topic. However, I only care about the part telling me how to lead a good life, or more formally, how to achieve happiness.

There are many (potential) ways to achieve happiness in additional to philosophy, such as religion and psychology. I have chosen the philosophical way, but recently I falter in my confidence in philosophy.

Philosophy helps people achieve happiness by teaching us the optimal strategy of leading our lives and helping us realize the truth that 'bad things' are not bad indeed, by observing the Universe and / or exercising our rational thinking. This method could be very persuasive because truths are always persuasive. This is different from religion which requires one to believe in something that is not provable (Note: Some people believe that their 'religion' is the only explanation to the Universe by reasoning and / or observation. If they are correct, their 'religion' is in fact philosophy but not religion. For example, if one can prove that the God in Christianity exists by reasoning and / or observations, Christianity is a philosophy but not a religion.). This is also different from psychology which does not care about whether bad things are indeed bad. Instead, psychology makes people think in a way that suit the design of humans' brain. In this sense, psychology is also teaching us the optimal strategy of leading our lives based on facts.

For philosophy, there is a potential issue that 'bad things' could be indeed bad. If this is the case, philosophy does not work perfectly. The worst case is that it reveals that life is indeed very difficult and makes people feel even more unhappy. It means that it is possible that even if we follow the optimal strategy, we can only minimize the number of bad things, but not eliminate all the bad things.

Philosophy teaches me the good (probably optimal) strategy of leading a life. This is useful for me to solve some problems, but is still not enough, because I am not yet convinced that 'bad things' are not bad. It helps me get closer to happiness, but not achieve happiness. Maybe I can get even closer to happiness with some help from psychology, especially when 'bad things' are indeed bad?
