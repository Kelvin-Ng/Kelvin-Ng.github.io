title: My Attitude on Doing what I have no Confidence in

Yesterday I participated in the CSE programming contest. It is an ACM ICPC-like contest, and I have no confidence in such kind of contests.

Problems are difficult to solve, as expected. I solved 2 problems out of 7, and ranked 10th. After learning the solutions, I found that most of the unsolved problems were really beyond my ability and it was not surprising for me to fail to solve, except one of them.

This problem is not difficult. In fact I was about to get the solution. In some sense I did get the solution. However, I did not continue to think in this line. I felt that it was too troublesome. I suddenly wanted to give up without any reason. So, I did not work out the solution.

That's a serious attitude problem and reminds me of many similar scenarios before. I easily give up a task that is beyond my expected ability. I am sure that I could solve this problem if it appeared in a course exam, because I am confident that I can solve all problems in an undergraduate course and so I will try my best to solve it.

Similarly, when a problem appeared in an algorithm design context, I failed to solve it because I was not confident in solving algorithm problems, but I could solve the same problem if it appeared in a system design context, because I am confident in my ability in system design.

I should not stay in the comfort zone. I should always try my very best to solve any problem, no matter it is what I am confident in or not.

I have to learn from this lesson.
