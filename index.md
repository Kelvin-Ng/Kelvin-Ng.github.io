I am a final year Computer Science student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk). My research interest is distributed and big data systems, especially on database systems. I am currently exploring the use of GPUs to solve similarity search and general big data problems.

I will start my Ph.D. study in Computer and Information Science at [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.cis.upenn.edu) in 2019 Fall.
