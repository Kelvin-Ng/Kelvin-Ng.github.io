I am a third-year Computer and Information Science PhD student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.cis.upenn.edu), advised by [Vincent Liu](http://vincen.tl). Before Penn, I completed my undergraduate at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk) and worked closely with [James Cheng](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~jcheng).

My research interests are in the broad area of systems and networking. My current and past research focuses especially on machine learning in the systems context. I am currently working on low-latency machine learning inference that facilitates the application of machine learning on critical decision-making in systems.
